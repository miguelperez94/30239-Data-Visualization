## Description of the project

This document analyses the generalized reduction in the household debt-to-income 
ratio that happened in the United States after the Great Recession between 2007 
and 2015 by using data at the state and county level.

While the data shows a huge disparity in the level and in the change of the
debt-to-income ratio among states and even more among counties, these
changes in debt-to-income ratios were handled more by richer counties,
and at least in a preliminary analysis don't show correlation between 
these changes and socioeconomic impacts such as unemployment, income,
and poverty.
