Title: An analysis at the US state and county level about the 
    reduction of the debt-to-income ratio between 2007 and 2017

Name of author: Miguel Pérez Rodríguez

Subject area of choice: Using mainly data about (a) county level of the
    household debt-to-income and (b) average personal income per county, and
    taking into consideration the huge reduction at the national level of the
    debt-to-income ratio between 2007 (1.24) to 2017 (0.95), I want
    to analyze and show visually the following points: 
        (i) how was this change of deb-to-income ratios by state and county 
            level (in part to highlight which states and counties had the biggest 
            changes between 2007 and 2017), 
        (ii) see relationships between average income and debt-to-income ratios
            among counties (to see if poorer or richer counties were the ones 
            that have the biggest impacts of the reduction of the debt household), 
            and 
        (iii) see if there are any correlational impact between changes in
            reductions of debt-to-income ratios and other outputs at a county or
            state level, such as unemployment rates, net migration, or crime rates,
            among others (this third point is still under review)

Likely data sources:
    (a) Federal Reserve, County-Level Household Debt-to-Income Ratio:
        (i) URL: https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/dataviz/household_debt/county/map/#state:all;year:2024
        (ii) Description: Ratio of household debt (from FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel/Equifax Data)
            and household income (from the Bureau of Labor Statistics). Due to 
            confidentiality, the data is in ranges (not an specific point, 
            but a range between a minimum and a maximum), so I would use the average 
            of the middle point of the range for three consecutive years
            to have a more precise metric (for 2007: average of 2007 to 2009, 
            for 2017: average of 2017 to 2019).
        (iii) Estimate of how many rows/columns: I estimate that this dataset
            will give me one observation for each county and state for years 2007
            and 2017, so this would be 2 columns (county/state and debt-to-income ratio)
            and approximately 6,400 observations (3,200 counties plus states, two times each).
